### Patch Changes

- [#195](https://github.com/actionbook/actionbook/pull/195) [`b173b12`](https://github.com/actionbook/actionbook/commit/b173b122f17a9fa40897e1ea8bc6a09dbb250a1b) Thanks [@Senke0x](https://github.com/Senke0x)! - Fix glibc compatibility for Debian 12 and Ubuntu 22.04 by pinning the linux-x64 build runner to ubuntu-22.04 (glibc 2.35), resolving "GLIBC_2.39 not found" errors on systems with glibc < 2.39

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- [#190](https://github.com/actionbook/actionbook/pull/190) [`af5cd35`](https://github.com/actionbook/actionbook/commit/af5cd3522a43aaa1906e422ef92e2aa290dfc293) Thanks [@ZhangHanDong](https://github.com/ZhangHanDong)! - Add Electron app automation and pydoll-inspired browser automation features

  **Electron App Automation:**

  - New `actionbook app` command for automating Electron desktop apps (VS Code, Slack, Discord, Figma, Notion, Spotify)
  - Auto-discover and launch apps with `app launch <name>`
  - Connect to running apps with `app attach <port>`
  - Full feature parity with browser commands (all 35+ commands work with app prefix)

  **Pydoll-Inspired Browser Features:**

  - Shadow DOM Support: Use `::shadow-root` selector syntax to interact with web components
  - IFrame Context Switching: Switch between main frame and iframes with `browser switch-frame`
  - Keyboard Hotkeys: Send keyboard combinations with `browser hotkey "Control+C"`
  - Scroll with Wait: Wait for scrollend event with `browser scroll down 500 --wait`

  **Bug Fixes:**

  - Fix iframe context switching to properly execute in target frame using CDP isolated worlds
  - Fix extension close command to prevent zombie processes
  - Fix Windows wildcard path expansion for app discovery

  All browser automation features are available in both `browser` and `app` commands.

## 0.8.3

### Patch Changes

- [#179](https://github.com/actionbook/actionbook/pull/179) [`a259b6d`](https://github.com/actionbook/actionbook/commit/a259b6d25560c7eaa2b66f6075dc5938a344086e) Thanks [@Senke0x](https://github.com/Senke0x)! - Fix CWS extension ID mismatch and browser close bridge lifecycle:

  - Support Chrome Web Store extension ID alongside dev extension ID for origin validation and native messaging
  - Remove misleading port change suggestion from bridge conflict error message
  - `browser close --extension` now fully cleans up bridge lifecycle: best-effort tab detach → stop bridge process → delete all state files (PID, port, token)

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- [#173](https://github.com/actionbook/actionbook/pull/173) [`a68fb6a`](https://github.com/actionbook/actionbook/commit/a68fb6a06f9fec17f440541a34464c308237ff03) Thanks [@Senke0x](https://github.com/Senke0x)! - Fix extension mode connectivity and harden bridge security:

  - Unify extension commands through `ExtensionBackend` with 30-second connection retry, fixing immediate "Extension not connected" failure when Chrome extension needs 2-6s to connect via Native Messaging
  - Restrict extension bridge auth to exact Actionbook extension ID (`native_messaging::EXTENSION_ID`), preventing other Chrome extensions from impersonating the bridge client
  - Harden extension bridge against spoofing and PID race conditions
  - Fix extension disconnect race, PID overflow guard, and bridge port constant
  - Resolve PID lifecycle, SIGKILL safety, mode priority, and config preservation bugs
  - Restore extension mode end-to-end pipeline and v0.7.5 setup wizard compatibility

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- [#170](https://github.com/actionbook/actionbook/pull/170) [`0329b54`](https://github.com/actionbook/actionbook/commit/0329b544b878b60d39c1bdcc0433452dd9f2ea79) Thanks [@ZhangHanDong](https://github.com/ZhangHanDong)! - Release actionbook-rs 0.8.0

  - Feature I1-I5: One-shot fetch, HTTP-first degradation, session tag tracking, URL rewriting, domain-aware wait
  - Feature J1: File upload support (DOM.setFileInputFiles + React SPA compatible)
  - Extended selector support: Playwright-style `:has-text()` and `:nth(N)` pseudo-selectors
  - Improved error handling and verification patterns

## 0.7.5

### Patch Changes

- [#159](https://github.com/actionbook/actionbook/pull/159) [`6ad3b57`](https://github.com/actionbook/actionbook/commit/6ad3b5708af1b16548c61e9f60121f72368229e5) Thanks [@Senke0x](https://github.com/Senke0x)! - Refine `actionbook setup` behavior for agent and non-interactive workflows:

  - remove `--agent-mode` and keep setup targeting via `--target`
  - keep `--target` quick mode only when used alone
  - run full setup when `--target` is combined with setup flags (for example `--non-interactive`, `--browser`, `--api-key`)
  - avoid forcing non-interactive/browser defaults from `--target`
  - preserve standalone target behavior by skipping skills integration in full setup
  - improve setup help text with agent-friendly non-interactive examples
